# CheckersBot

This repository is a checkers simulation developed as part of the CheckersBot 
project in CSCI-C 458: Intelligent Robots and Indiana University Southeast. 
The goal of this project is to develop a robotic system capable of playing 
a simplified version of checkers. The overall project consists of three 
subsystems: a decision maker, a computer vision system, and a robotic system.  

The code found in this repository is part of the decision maker subsystem. It 
is built using an iterative deepening depth-first minimax search with 
Alpha-Beta pruning. This repository contains a fully functional checkers game. 
Instructions for playing can be found below.
